-- Filtering using a subquery with a list
-- Your goal in this exercise is to generate a list of teams that never played a game in their home city. 
-- Using a subquery, you will generate a list of unique hometeam_ID values from the unfiltered match table to exclude in the team table's team_api_ID column.
-- In addition to filtering using a single-value (scalar) subquery, you can create a list of values in a subquery to filter data based on a complex set of conditions.
-- This type of subquery generates a one column reference list for the main query. 
-- As long as the values in your list match a column in your main query's table, you don't need to use a join -- even if the list is from a separate table.

-- Subqueries in Select for Calculations
-- Subqueries in SELECT are a useful way to create calculated columns in a query. A subquery in SELECT can be treated as a single numeric value to use in your calculations. 
-- When writing queries in SELECT, it's important to remember that filtering the main query does not filter the subquery -- and vice versa.
-- In the previous exercise, you created a column to compare each league's average total goals to the overall average goals in the 2013/2014 season. 
-- In this exercise, you will add a column that directly compares these values by subtracting the overall average from the subquery.

-- Select the average goals scored in a match for each league in the main query.
-- Select the average goals scored in a match overall for the 2013/2014 season in the subquery.
-- Subtract the subquery from the average number of goals calculated for each league.
-- Filter the main query so that only games from the 2013/2014 season are included.

Get team names with a subquery
Let's solve a problem we've encountered a few times in this course so far -- How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?
Out of the 4 techniques we just discussed, this can be performed using subqueries, correlated subqueries, and CTEs. Let's practice creating similar result sets using each of these 3 methods over the next 3 exercises, starting with subqueries in FROM.



SELECT
	m.date,
    -- Get the home and away team names
    home.hometeam,
    away.awayteam,
    m.home_goal,
    m.away_goal
FROM match AS m

-- Join the home subquery to the match table
inner join (
  SELECT match.id, team.team_long_name AS hometeam
  FROM match
  LEFT JOIN team
  ON match.hometeam_id = team.team_api_id) AS home
ON home.id = m.id

-- Join the away subquery to the match table
inner join (
  SELECT match.id, team.team_long_name AS awayteam
  FROM match
  LEFT JOIN team
  -- Get the away team ID in the subquery
  ON match.awayteam_id = team.team_api_id) AS away
ON away.id = m.id;



SELECT
    m.date,
   (SELECT team_long_name
    FROM team AS t
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam
FROM match AS m;


SELECT
    m.date,
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam,
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.awayteam_id) AS awayteam,
    -- Select home and away goals
     home_goal,
     away_goal
FROM match AS m;



SELECT 
	-- Select match id and team long name
    m.id, 
    t.team_long_name AS hometeam
FROM match AS m
-- Join team to match using team_api_id and hometeam_id
LEFT JOIN team AS t 
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id;



Get team names with CTEs
You've now explored two methods for answering the question, How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?
Let's explore the final method - common table expressions.
Common table expressions are similar to the subquery method for generating results, mainly differing in syntax and the order in which information is processed.

-- Declare the home CTE
with home as (
	SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name AS hometeam
	FROM match AS m
	LEFT JOIN team AS t 
	ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id)
-- Select everything from home
SELECT *
FROM home;



WITH home AS (
  SELECT m.id, m.date, 
  		 t.team_long_name AS hometeam, m.home_goal
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t 
  ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),
-- Declare and set up the away CTE
away as (
  SELECT m.id, m.date, 
  		 t.team_long_name AS awayteam, m.away_goal
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t 
  ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)
-- Select date, home_goal, and away_goal

SELECT 
	home.date,
    home.hometeam,
    away.awayteam,
    home.home_goal,
    away.away_goal
-- Join away and home on the id column
FROM home
INNER JOIN away
ON home.id = away.id;



The match is OVER
The OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. 
The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster,
and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions and clauses you can include with it that we will cover later on in this chapter.
In this exercise, you will revise some queries from previous chapters using the OVER() clause.
Select the match ID, country name, season, home, and away goals from the match and country tables.
Complete the query that calculates the average number of goals scored overall and then includes the aggregate value in each row using a window function.




SELECT 
	-- Select the id, country name, season, home, and away goals
	m.id, 
    c.name AS country, 
    m.season,
	m.home_goal,
	m.away_goal,
    -- Use a window to include the aggregate average in each row
	avg (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) over() AS overall_avg
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;





What's OVER here? Window functions allow you to create a RANK of information according to any variable you want to use to sort your data. 
When setting this up, you will need to specify what column/calculation you want to use to calculate your rank. 
This is done by including an ORDER BY clause inside the OVER() clause. Below is an example:


SELECT 
    id,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal) AS rank
FROM match;
In this exercise, you will create a data set of ranked matches according to which leagues, on average, score the most goals in a match.


Select the league name and average total goals scored from league and match.
Complete the window function so it calculates the rank of average goals scored across all leagues in the database.
Order the rank by the average total of home and away goals scored.

SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    avg(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank each league according to the average goals
    rank() OVER(order by AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal)) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;



The PARTITION BY clause allows you to calculate separate "windows" based on columns you want to divide your results. 
For example, you can create a single column that calculates an overall average of goals scored for each season.
In this exercise, you will be creating a data set of games played by Legia Warszawa (Warsaw League),
the top ranked team in Poland, and comparing their individual game performance to the overall average for that season.

Where do you see more outliers? Are they Legia Warszawa's home or away games?
Complete the two window functions that calculate the home and away goal averages. 
Partition the window functions by season to calculate separate averages for each season.
Filter the query to only include matches played by Legia Warszawa, id = 8673.



SELECT
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
		 ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
    -- Calculate the average goals scored partitioned by season
    avg(home_goal) over(partition by season) AS season_homeavg,
    avg(away_goal) over(partition by season) AS season_awayavg
FROM match
-- Filter the data set for Legia Warszawa matches only
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673 
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;





SELECT 
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
         ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
	-- Calculate average goals partitioned by season and month
	AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
         	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_home,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_away
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;




Slide to the left
Sliding windows allow you to create running calculations between any two points in a window using functions such as PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, and CURRENT ROW. 
You can calculate running counts, sums, averages, and other aggregate functions between any two points you specify in the data set.

In this exercise, you will expand on the examples discussed in the video, calculating the running total of goals scored by the FC Utrecht 
when they were the home team during the 2011/2012 season. Do they score more goals at the end of the season as the home or away team?

Complete the window function by:
Assessing the running total of home goals scored by FC Utrecht.
Assessing the running average of home goals scored.
Ordering both the running average and running total by date.


SELECT 
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
    -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
    sum(home_goal) over(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED  preceding AND current row) AS running_total,
    avg(home_goal) over(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED  preceding AND current row ) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 9908 
	AND season = '2011/2012';
