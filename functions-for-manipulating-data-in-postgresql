As we saw in the video, PostgreSQL has a system database called INFORMATION_SCHEMA that allows us to extract information about objects, including tables, in our database.
In this exercise we will look at how to query the tables table of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database to discover information about tables in the DVD Rentals database 
including the name, type, schema, and catalog of all tables and views and then how to use the results to get additional information about columns in our tables.
Select all columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES system database. Limit results that have a public table_schema.

 -- Select all columns from the TABLES system database
 SELECT * 
 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tables
 -- Filter by schema
 WHERE table_schema = 'public';
 
 
 
 Select all columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS system database. Limit by table_name to actor
 
  -- Select all columns from the COLUMNS system database
 SELECT * 
 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
 WHERE table_name = 'actor';
