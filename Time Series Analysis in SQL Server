Break out a date into year, month, and day
SQL Server has a number of functions dedicated to working with date types. 
We will first analyze three functions that return integers representing the year, month, and day of month, respectively.
These functions can allow us to group dates together, letting us calculate running totals by year or month-over-month comparisons of expenditures. 
We could also analyze sales by calendar day of the month to determine if there is a strong monthly cycle.
Use the YEAR(), MONTH(), and DAY() functions to determine the year, month, and day for the current date and time.

DECLARE
	@SomeTime DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Retrieve the year, month, and day
SELECT
	year(@SomeTime) AS TheYear,
	month(@SomeTime) AS TheMonth,
	day(@SomeTime) AS TheDay;
  
  
  
Break a date and time into component parts
Although YEAR(), MONTH(), and DAY() are helpful functions and are easy to remember, we often want to break out dates into different component parts
such as the day of week, week of year, and second after the minute. This is where functions like DATEPART() and DATENAME() come into play.
Here we will use the night the Berlin Wall fell, November 9th, 1989.
Using the DATEPART() function, fill in the appropriate date parts. 
For a list of parts, review https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datepart-transact-sql

DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';

-- Fill in each date part
SELECT
	DATEPART(year, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,
	DATEPART(month, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheMonth,
	DATEPART(day, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDay,
	DATEPART(dayofyear, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATEPART(week, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATEPART(second, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATEPART(nanosecond, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;
  
Results -->
TheYear	TheMonth	TheDay	TheDayOfYear	TheDayOfWeek	TheWeek	TheSecond	TheNanosecond
1989	  11	      9	        313	          5	            45	    36	      229485200



Using the DATENAME() function, fill in the appropriate function calls.
DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';
-- Fill in the function to show the name of each date part
SELECT
	DATENAME(YEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,

	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATENAME(WEEK, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATENAME(SECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATENAME(NANOSECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;

Date math and leap years
Some of you may have experience using R and here we note that leap year date math can be tricky with R and the lubridate package. 
lubridate has two types of functions: duration and period.
lubridate::ymd(20120229) - lubridate::dyears(4) --> 2008-03-01, which is wrong.
lubridate::ymd(20120229) - lubridate::dyears(1) --> 2011-03-01, which is correct.
lubridate::ymd(20120229) - lubridate::years(4) --> 2008-02-29, which is correct.
lubridate::ymd(20120229) - lubridate::years(1) --> NA, which is unexpected behavior.
We can use the DATEADD() and DATEDIFF() functions to see how SQL Server deals with leap years to see if it has any of the same eccentricities.
Fill in the date parts and intervals needed to determine how SQL Server works on February 29th of a leap year.
2012 was a leap year. The leap year before it was 4 years earlier, and the leap year after it was 4 years later.


DECLARE
	@LeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-02-29 18:00:00';

-- Fill in the date parts and intervals as needed
SELECT
	DATEADD(day, -1, @LeapDay) AS PriorDay,
	DATEADD(day, 1, @LeapDay) AS NextDay,
    -- For leap years, we need to move 4 years, not just 1
	DATEADD(YEAR, -4, @LeapDay) AS PriorLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @LeapDay) AS NextLeapYear,
	DATEADD(year, -1, @LeapDay) AS PriorYear;
  PriorDay	            NextDay	              PriorLeapYear	      NextLeapYear	    PriorYear
2012-02-28  18:00:00	2012-03-01 18:00:00	2008-02-29 18:00:00	2016-02-29 18:00:00	2011-02-28 18:00:00
  
  
  
  DECLARE
	@PostLeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-03-01 18:00:00';

-- Fill in the date parts and intervals as needed
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, -1, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorDay,
	DATEADD(DAY, 1, @PostLeapDay) AS NextDay,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -4, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @PostLeapDay) AS NextLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -1, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorYear,
    -- Move 4 years forward and one day back
	DATEADD(day, -1, DATEADD(year, 4, @PostLeapDay)) AS NextLeapDay,
    DATEADD(day, -2, @PostLeapDay) AS TwoDaysAgo;
    
    
 PriorDay	          NextDay	              PriorLeapYear	      NextLeapYear	      PriorYear	          NextLeapDay	        TwoDaysAgo
2012-02-29 18:00:00	2012-03-02 18:00:00	2008-03-01 18:00:00	2016-03-01 18:00:00	2011-03-01 18:00:00	2016-02-29 18:00:00	2012-02-28 18:00:00



Taking TwoDaysAgo from the prior step, use the DATEDIFF() function to test how it handles leap years.
DECLARE
	@PostLeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-03-01 18:00:00',
    @TwoDaysAgo DATETIME2(7);

SELECT
	@TwoDaysAgo = DATEADD(DAY, -2, @PostLeapDay);

SELECT
	@TwoDaysAgo AS TwoDaysAgo,
	@PostLeapDay AS SomeTime,
    -- Fill in the appropriate function and date types
	datediff(day, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS DaysDifference,
	datediff(hour, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS HoursDifference,
	datediff(minute, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS MinutesDifference;
  
  TwoDaysAgo	          SomeTime	          DaysDifference	HoursDifference	    MinutesDifference
2012-02-28 18:00:00	  2012-03-01 18:00:00	      2	              48	            2880




Rounding dates
SQL Server does not have an intuitive way to round down to the month, hour, or minute. 
You can, however, combine the DATEADD() and DATEDIFF() functions to perform this rounding.
To round the date 1914-08-16 down to the year, we would call DATEADD(YEAR, DATEDIFF(YEAR, 0, '1914-08-16'), 0). 
To round that date down to the month, we would call DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, '1914-08-16'), 0).
This works for several other date parts as well.
Use DATEADD() and DATEDIFF() in conjunction with date parts to round down our time to the day, hour, and minute.

DECLARE
	@SomeTime DATETIME2(7) = '2018-06-14 16:29:36.2248991';

-- Fill in the appropriate functions and date parts
SELECT
	DATEADD(day, DATEDIFF(day, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToDay,
	DATEADD(hour, DATEDIFF(hour, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToHour,
	DATEADD(minute, DATEDIFF(minute, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToMinute;
  
  
RoundedToDay	        RoundedToHour	        RoundedToMinute
2018-06-14 00:00:00	2018-06-14 16:00:00	    2018-06-14 16:29:00




Formatting dates with CAST() and CONVERT()
We can use the CAST() function to translate data between various data types, including between date/time types and string types. 
The CONVERT() function takes three parameters: a data type, an input value, and an optional format code.
In this exercise, we will see how we can use the CAST() and CONVERT() functions to translate dates to strings for formatting
by looking at the (late) night the Chicago Cubs won the World Series in the US in 2016. 
In the process, we will see one difference between the DATETIME and the DATETIME2 data types for CAST() and the added flexibility of CONVERT().
Fill in the appropriate function, CAST(), for each example.
Using the aliases as a guide, fill in the appropriate variable for each example.

DECLARE
	@CubsWinWorldSeries DATETIME2(3) = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245',
	@OlderDateType DATETIME = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245';

SELECT
	-- Fill in the missing function calls
	cast(@CubsWinWorldSeries AS DATE) AS CubsWinDateForm,
	cast(@CubsWinWorldSeries AS NVARCHAR(30)) AS CubsWinStringForm,
	cast(@OlderDateType AS DATE) AS OlderDateForm,
	cast(@OlderDateType AS NVARCHAR(30)) AS OlderStringForm;

SELECT
	cast(cast(@CubsWinWorldSeries AS date) AS NVARCHAR(30)) AS DateStringForm;
	


Use the CONVERT() function to translate the date the Cubs won the world series into the DATE and NVARCHAR(30) data types.
The functional form for CONVERT() is CONVERT(DataType, SomeValue).

DECLARE
	@CubsWinWorldSeries DATETIME2(3) = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245';

Formatting dates with FORMAT()
The FORMAT() function allows for additional flexibility in building dates. It takes in three parameters: 
the input value, the input format, and an optional culture (such as en-US for US English or zh-cn for Simplified Chinese).
In the following exercises, we will investigate three separate methods for formatting dates using the FORMAT() function
against the day that Python 3 became generally available: December 3rd, 2008.
Fill in the function and use the 'd' format parameter (note that this is case sensitive!) to format as short dates. 
Also, fill in the culture for Japan, which in the .NET framework is jp-JP (this is not case sensitive).

DECLARE
	@Python3ReleaseDate DATETIME2(3) = '2008-12-03 19:45:00.033';

SELECT
	-- Fill in the function call and format parameter
	format(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'd', 'en-US') AS US_d,
	format(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'd', 'de-DE') AS DE_d,
	-- Fill in the locale for Japan
	format(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'd', 'jp-JP') AS JP_d,
	format(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'd', 'zh-cn') AS CN_d;
	
US_d		DE_d		JP_d		CN_d
12/3/2008	03.12.2008	12/03/2008	2008/12/3



Fill in the custom format strings needed to generate the results in preceding comments. 
Use date parts such as yyyy, MM, MMM, and dd. 
Capitalization is important for the FORMAT() function! See the full list at https://bit.ly/30SGA5a.

DECLARE
	@Python3ReleaseDate DATETIME2(3) = '2008-12-03 19:45:00.033';
    
SELECT
	-- 20081203
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'yyyyMMdd') AS F1,
	-- 2008-12-03
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS F2,
	-- Dec 03+2008 (the + is just a "+" character)
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'MMM dd+yyyy') AS F3,
	-- 12 08 03 (month, two-digit year, day)
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'MM yy dd') AS F4,
	-- 03 07:45 2008.00
    -- (day hour:minute year.second)
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'dd hh:mm yyyy.ss') AS F5;
	


Try out a calendar table
Calendar tables are also known in the warehousing world as date dimensions. 
A calendar table is a helpful utility table which you can use to perform date range calculations quickly and efficiently. 
This is especially true when dealing with fiscal years, which do not always align to a calendar year, or holidays which may not be on the same date every year.
In our example company, the fiscal year starts on July 1 of the current calendar year, so Fiscal Year 2019 started on July 1, 2019 and goes through June 30, 2020. 
All of this information is in a table called dbo.Calendar.
Find the dates of all Tuesdays in December covering the calendar years 2008 through 2010.
	

-- Find Tuesdays in December for calendar years 2008-2010
SELECT
	c.Date
FROM dbo.Calendar c
WHERE
	c.MonthName = 'December'
	AND c.DayName = 'Tuesday'
	AND c.CalendarYear BETWEEN 2008 AND 2010
ORDER BY
	c.Date;

Joining to a calendar table
In the prior exercise, we looked at a new table, dbo.Calendar. 
This table contains pre-calculated date information stretching from January 1st, 2000 through December 31st, 2049. 
Now we want to use this calendar table to filter another table, dbo.IncidentRollup.
The Incident Rollup table contains artificially-generated data relating to security incidents at a fictitious company.
You may recall from prerequisite courses how to join tables. Here's an example of joining to a calendar table:

SELECT
    t.Column1,
    t.Column2
FROM dbo.Table t
    INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
        ON t.Date = c.Date;
Fill in the blanks to determine which dates had type 3 incidents during the third fiscal quarter of FY2019.



select
fystart = dateadd(month, -6, dateadd(year, datediff(year, 0, dateadd(month, 6, d.[date])),0),
fiscalDayofYear = datediff(day, dateadd(month, -6, datedd(year, datediff(year, 0, dateadd(month,6,d.[date])), d.[date]) + 1),
fiscalweekoftheyear = datediff(week, dateadd(month, -6, dateadd(year, datediff(year, 0, dateadd(month,6,d.[date])), d.[date]) + 1
from dbo.Calendar



select 
fy.FYStart, 
fiscaldayoftheyear = datediff(day, fy.FYStart, d.[Date]) + 1,
fiscalweekoftheyear = datediff(week, fy.FYStart, d.[Date]) + 1,
from dbo.Calendar
cross APPLY ( select fyStart = dateadd(month, -6, dateadd(year, datediff(year,0, dateadd(month, 6, d.[date])), 0))) fy;

Build dates from parts
The DATEFROMPARTS() function allows us to turn a series of numbers representing date parts into a valid DATE data type. 
In this exercise, we will learn how to use DATEFROMPARTS() to build dates from components in a calendar table.
Although the calendar table already has dates in it, this helps us visualize circumstances in which the base table has integer date components
but no date value, which might happen when importing data from flat files directly into a database.
Create dates from component parts in the calendar table: calendar year, calendar month, and the day of the month.
-- Create dates from component parts on the calendar table
SELECT TOP(10)
	DATEFROMPARTS(c.CalendarYear, c.CalendarMonth, c.day) AS CalendarDate
FROM dbo.Calendar c
WHERE
	c.CalendarYear = 2017
ORDER BY
	c.FiscalDayOfYear ASC;



Create dates from the component parts of the calendar table. Use the calendar year, calendar month, and day of month.
SELECT TOP(10)
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.MonthName,
	c.CalendarDayOfYear
FROM dbo.Calendar c
WHERE
	-- Create dates from component parts
	DATEFROMPARTS(c.CalendarYear, c.CalendarMonth, c.Day) >= '2018-06-01'
	AND c.DayName = 'Tuesday'
ORDER BY
	c.FiscalYear,
	c.FiscalDayOfYear ASC;

Build dates and times from parts
SQL Server has several functions for generating date and time combinations from parts. 
In this exercise, we will look at DATETIME2FROMPARTS() and DATETIMEFROMPARTS().
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo 11 Lunar Module--nicknamed The Eagle--on the moon on July 20th, 1969 at 20:17 UTC. 
They remained on the moon for approximately 21 1/2 hours, taking off on July 21st, 1969 at 18:54 UTC.
Build the date and time (using DATETIME2FROMPARTS()) that Neil and Buzz became the first people to land on the moon. 
Note the "2" in DATETIME2FROMPARTS(), meaning we want to build a DATETIME2 rather than a DATETIME.
Build the date and time (using DATETIMEFROMPARTS()) that Neil and Buzz took off from the moon. Note that this is for a DATETIME, not a DATETIME2.

SELECT
	-- Mark the date and time the lunar module touched down
    -- Use 24-hour notation for hours, so e.g., 9 PM is 21
	DATETIME2FROMPARTS(1969, 07, 20, 20, 17, 00, 000, 0) AS TheEagleHasLanded,
	-- Mark the date and time the lunar module took back off
    -- Use 24-hour notation for hours, so e.g., 9 PM is 21
	DATETIMEFROMPARTS(1969, 07, 21, 18, 54, 00, 000) AS MoonDeparture;


Build dates and times with offsets from parts
The DATETIMEOFFSETFROMPARTS() function builds a DATETIMEOFFSET out of component values. 
It has the most input parameters of any date and time builder function.
On January 19th, 2038 at 03:14:08 UTC (that is, 3:14:08 AM), we will experience the Year 2038 (or Y2.038K) problem.
This is the moment that 32-bit devices will reset back to the date 1900-01-01. 
This runs the risk of breaking every 32-bit device using POSIX time, which is the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 at midnight UTC.
Build a DATETIMEOFFSET which represents the last millisecond before the Y2.038K problem hits. The offset should be UTC.
Build a DATETIMEOFFSET which represents the moment devices hit the Y2.038K issue in UTC time. 
Then use the AT TIME ZONE operator to convert this to Eastern Standard Time.


SELECT
	-- Fill in the millisecond PRIOR TO chaos
	DATETIMEOFFSETFROMPARTS(2038, 01, 19, 03, 14, 07, 999, 0, 0, 3) AS LastMoment,
    -- Fill in the date and time when we will experience the Y2.038K problem
    -- Then convert to the Eastern Standard Time time zone
	DATETIMEOFFSETFROMPARTS(2038, 01, 19, 03, 14, 08, 0, 0, 0, 3) AT TIME ZONE 'Eastern Standard Time' AS TimeForChaos;
	


Cast strings to dates
The CAST() function allows us to turn strings into date and time data types. In this example, we will review many of the formats CAST() can handle.
Review the data in the dbo.Dates table which has been pre-loaded for you. 
Then use the CAST() function to convert these dates twice: once into a DATE type and once into a DATETIME2(7) type. 
Because one of the dates includes data down to the nanosecond, we cannot convert to a DATETIME type or any DATETIME2 type with less precision.
NOTE: the CAST() function is language- and locale-specific, meaning that for a SQL Server instance configured for US English, 
it will translate 08/23/2008 as 2008-08-23 but it will fail on 23/08/2008, which a SQL Server with the French Canadian locale can handle.
Cast the input string DateText in the dbo.Dates temp table to the DATE data type.
Cast the input string DateText in the dbo.Dates temp table to the DATETIME2(7) data type.

SELECT
	d.DateText AS String,
	-- Cast as DATE
	cast(d.DateText AS DATE) AS StringAsDate,
	-- Cast as DATETIME2(7)
	cast(d.DateText AS DATETIME2(7)) AS StringAsDateTime2
FROM dbo.Dates d;




Convert strings to dates
The CONVERT() function behaves similarly to CAST(). When translating strings to dates, the two functions do exactly the same work under the covers. 
Although we used all three parameters for CONVERT() during a prior exercise in Chapter 1, we will only need two parameters here: the data type and input expression.
In this exercise, we will once again look at a table called dbo.Dates. This time around, we will get dates in from our German office. 
In order to handle German dates, we will need to use SET LANGUAGE to change the language in our current session to German. 
This affects date and time formats and system messages.
Try querying the dbo.Dates table first to see how things differ from the prior exercise.
Use the CONVERT() function to translate DateText into a date data type.
Then use the CONVERT() function to translate DateText into a DATETIME2(7) data type.

SET LANGUAGE 'GERMAN'

SELECT
	d.DateText AS String,
	-- Convert to DATE
	convert(DATE, d.DateText) AS StringAsDate,
	-- Convert to DATETIME2(7)
	convert(datetime2(7), d.DateText) AS StringAsDateTime2
FROM dbo.Dates d;




Parse strings to dates
Changing our language for data loading is not always feasible. 
Instead of using the SET LANGUAGE syntax, we can instead use the PARSE() function to parse a string as a date type using a specific locale.
We will once again use the dbo.Dates table, this time parsing all of the dates as German using the de-de locale.
Parse DateText as dates using the German locale (de-de).
Then, parse DateText as the data type DATETIME2(7), still using the German locale.

SELECT
	d.DateText AS String,
	-- Parse as DATE using German
	parse(d.DateText AS DATE USING 'de-de') AS StringAsDate,
	-- Parse as DATETIME2(7) using German
	parse(d.DateText AS DATETIME2(7) USING 'de-de') AS StringAsDateTime2
FROM dbo.Dates d;





Changing a date's offset
We can use the SWITCHOFFSET() function to change the time zone of a DATETIME, DATETIME2, or DATETIMEOFFSET typed date or a valid date string. 
SWITCHOFFSET() takes two parameters: the date or string as input and the time zone offset. 
It returns the time in that new time zone, so 3:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time will become 2:00 AM Central Daylight Time.
The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro started at 11 PM UTC on August 8th, 2016. 
Starting with a string containing that date and time, we can see what time that was in other locales.
Fill in the appropriate function call for Brasilia, Brazil.
Fill in the appropriate function call and time zone for Chicago, Illinois. 
In August, Chicago is 2 hours behind Brasilia Standard Time.
Fill in the appropriate function call and time zone for New Delhi, India. 
India does not observe Daylight Savings Time, so in August, New Delhi is 8 1/2 hours ahead of Brasilia Standard Time. 
Note when calculating time zones that Brasilia and New Delhi are on opposite sides of UTC.


DECLARE
	@OlympicsUTC NVARCHAR(50) = N'2016-08-08 23:00:00';

SELECT
	-- Fill in the time zone for Brasilia, Brazil
	SWITCHOFFSET(@OlympicsUTC, '-03:00') AS BrasiliaTime,
	-- Fill in the time zone for Chicago, Illinois
	SWITCHOFFSET(@OlympicsUTC, '-05:00') AS ChicagoTime,
	-- Fill in the time zone for New Delhi, India
	SWITCHOFFSET(@OlympicsUTC, '+05:30') AS NewDelhiTime;
	

BrasiliaTime				ChicagoTime				NewDelhiTime
2016-08-08 20:00:00.0000000 -03:00	2016-08-08 18:00:00.0000000 -05:00	2016-08-09 04:30:00.0000000 +05:30



Using the time zone DMV to look up times
The SWITCHOFFSET() function has an undesirable limitation: you need to know the offset value yourself. 
You might memorize that US Eastern Standard Time is UTC -5:00 and Eastern Daylight Time is UTC -04:00, 
but knowing India Standard Time or Tuvalu Time might be a stretch.
Fortunately, we have a Dynamic Management View (DMV) available to help us: sys.time_zone_info. 
This searches the set of time zones available on the operating system (in the Windows registry or /usr/share/zoneinfo on Linux or macOS).
The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro started at 11 PM UTC on August 8th, 2016. 
Starting with a string containing that date and time, we can see what time that was in other locales knowing only the time zone name but not its offset.


select @olympicUTC NVARCHAR(60) = N'2016-08-08 23:00:00'
select SWITCHOFFSET(@olympicUTC, tzi.current_utc_offset) as NDelhitime
from sys.time_zone_info as tzi 
where
tzi.name = N'Indian Standard Time';

Converting to a date offset
In addition to SWITCHOFFSET(), we can use the TODATETIMEOFFSET() to turn an existing date into a date type with an offset. 
If our starting time is in UTC, we will need to correct for time zone and then append an offset. 
To correct for the time zone, we can add or subtract hours (and minutes) manually.
Closing ceremonies for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro began at 11 PM UTC on August 21st, 2016. 
Starting with a string containing that date and time, we can see what time that was in other locales. 
For the time in Phoenix, Arizona, you know that they observe Mountain Standard Time, which is UTC -7 year-round.
The island chain of Tuvalu has its own time which is 12 hours ahead of UTC.
Fill in the time in Phoenix, Arizona, which, being Mountain Standard Time, was UTC -07:00.
Fill in the time for Tuvalu, which is 12 hours ahead of UTC.


DECLARE
	@OlympicsClosingUTC DATETIME2(0) = '2016-08-21 23:00:00';

SELECT
	-- Fill in 7 hours back and a '-07:00' offset
	TODATETIMEOFFSET(DATEADD(HOUR, -7, @OlympicsClosingUTC), '-07:00') AS PhoenixTime,
	-- Fill in 12 hours forward and a '+12:00' offset.
	TODATETIMEOFFSET(DATEADD(HOUR, +12, @OlympicsClosingUTC), '+12:00') AS TuvaluTime;
	
PhoenixTime				TuvaluTime
2016-08-21 16:00:00.0000000 -07:00	2016-08-22 11:00:00.0000000 +12:00



The SWITCHOFFSET() function is better for these types of time zone conversions but TODATETIMEOFFSET() can do in a pinch.
Where this function excels is taking normal dates in a database and converting them in preparation for storage as DATETIMEOFFSET types.




Performance gradation:
CONVERT() - 250k conversion per second
CAST() - 240k conversion per second
PARSE() - 12k conversion per second


Try out type-safe date functions
In this exercise, we will try out the TRY_CONVERT(), TRY_CAST(), and TRY_PARSE() set of functions. 
Each of these functions will safely parse string data and attempt to convert to another type, returning NULL if the conversion fails. 
Conversion to, e.g., a date type can fail for several reasons. 
If the input string is not a date, conversion will fail. If the input type is in a potentially ambiguous format, conversion might fail. 
An example of this is the date 04/01/2019 which has a different meaning in the United States (April 1, 2019) versus most European countries (January 4th, 2019).
Starting with the TRY_CONVERT() function, fill in the function name and input parameter for each example.

DECLARE
	@GoodDateINTL NVARCHAR(30) = '2019-03-01 18:23:27.920',

	TRY_CAST(@BadDate AS DATETIME2(3)) AS BadDate;

SELECT
	TRY_PARSE(@GoodDateINTL AS DATETIME2(3)) AS GoodDateINTL,

Convert imported data to dates with time zones
Now that we have seen the three type-safe conversion functions, we can begin to apply them against real data sets. 
In this scenario, we will parse data from the dbo.ImportedTime table.
We used a different application to load data from this table and looked at it in a prior exercise. 
This time, we will retrieve data for all rows, not just the ones the importing application marked as valid.
Fill in the missing TRY_XXX() function name inside the EventDates common table expression.
Convert the EventDateOffset event dates to 'UTC'. Call this output EventDateUTC.
Convert the EventDateOffset event dates to 'US Eastern Standard Time' using AT TIME ZONE. Call this output EventDateUSEast.



WITH EventDates AS
(
    SELECT
        -- Fill in the missing try-conversion function
        TRY_CONVERT(DATETIME2(3), it.EventDate) AT TIME ZONE it.TimeZone AS EventDateOffset,
        it.TimeZone
    FROM dbo.ImportedTime it
        INNER JOIN sys.time_zone_info tzi
			ON it.TimeZone = tzi.name
)
SELECT
    -- Fill in the approppriate event date to convert
	CONVERT(NVARCHAR(50), ed.EventDateOffset) AS EventDateOffsetString,
	CONVERT(DATETIME2(0), ed.EventDateOffset) AS EventDateLocal,
	ed.TimeZone,
    -- Convert from a DATETIMEOFFSET to DATETIME at UTC
	CAST(ed.EventDateOffset AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AS DATETIME2(0)) AS EventDateUTC,
    -- Convert from a DATETIMEOFFSET to DATETIME with time zone
	CAST(ed.EventDateOffset at time zone 'US Eastern Standard Time'  AS DATETIME2(0)) AS EventDateUSEast
FROM EventDates ed;


EventDateOffsetString		EventDateLocal		TimeZone			EventDateUTC		EventDateUSEast
2019-04-08 08:00:00.000 +09:30	2019-04-08 08:00:00	Cen. Australia Standard Time	2019-04-07 22:30:00	2019-04-07 18:30:00
2019-04-08 08:00:00.000 -04:00	2019-04-08 08:00:00	US Eastern Standard Time	2019-04-08 12:00:00	2019-04-08 08:00:00


There is no safe version of AT TIME ZONE, so we need to ensure that the time zones themselves are good. 
Also, once input values are known good, we are able to switch from TRY_CONVERT() to CONVERT().





Test type-safe conversion function performance
In the last two exercises, we looked at the TRY_CAST(), TRY_CONVERT(), and TRY_PARSE() functions. 
These functions do not all perform equally well. In this exercise, you will run a performance test against all of the dates in our calendar table.
To make it easier, we have pre-loaded dates in the dbo.Calendar table into a temp table called DateText, where there is a single NVARCHAR(50) column called DateText.
For the first three steps, the instructions will be the same: fill in missing values to complete the relevant function call. 
After doing that, observe the amount of time each operation takes and keep the results in mind. You will then summarize your results in step 4.
Fill in the correct conversion function based on its parameter signature.
Note the amount of time returned in the DATEDIFF() call.
Do not use @StartTimeCast or @EndTimeCast in your answer; these are for calculating execution time.




-- Try out how fast the TRY_CAST() function is
-- by try-casting each DateText value to DATE
DECLARE @StartTimeCast DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();
SELECT TRY_CAST(DateText as DATE) AS TestDate FROM #DateText;
DECLARE @EndTimeCast DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Determine how much time the conversion took by
-- calculating the date difference from @StartTimeCast to @EndTimeCast
SELECT
    DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTimeCast, @EndTimeCast) AS ExecutionTimeCast;
    
    
Fill in the correct conversion function based on its parameter signature.
Note the amount of time returned in the DATEDIFF() call.
Do not use @StartTimeCast or @EndTimeCast in your answer; these are for calculating execution time.




-- Try out how fast the TRY_CONVERT() function is
-- by try-converting each DateText value to DATE
DECLARE @StartTimeConvert DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();
SELECT try_convert(date, DateText) AS TestDate FROM #DateText;
DECLARE @EndTimeConvert DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Determine how much time the conversion took by
-- calculating the difference from start time to end time
SELECT
    DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTimeConvert, @EndTimeConvert) AS ExecutionTimeConvert;
    



-- Try out how fast the TRY_PARSE() function is
-- by try-parsing each DateText value to DATE
DECLARE @StartTimeParse DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();
SELECT TRY_PARSE(DateText as DATE) AS TestDate FROM #DateText;
DECLARE @EndTimeParse DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Determine how much time the conversion took by
-- calculating the difference from start time to end time
SELECT
    DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTimeParse, @EndTimeParse) AS ExecutionTimeParse;
    
    
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Calculating distinct counts
The COUNT() function has a variant which can be quite useful: COUNT(DISTINCT). 
This distinct count function allows us to calculate the number of unique elements in a data set, 
so COUNT(DISTINCT x.Y) will get the unique number of values for column Y on the table aliased as x.
In this example, we will continue to look at incident rollup data in the dbo.IncidentRollup table. 
Management would like to know how many unique incident types we have in our three-month data set as well as the number of days with incidents. 
They already know the total number of incidents because you gave them that information in the last exercise.
Return the count of distinct incident type IDs as NumberOfIncidentTypes
Return the count of distinct incident dates as NumberOfDaysWithIncidents
Fill in the appropriate function call and input column to determine number of unique incident types and number of days with incidents in our rollup table.

-- Fill in the functions and columns
SELECT
	count(distinct ir.IncidentTypeID) AS NumberOfIncidentTypes,
	count(distinct ir.IncidentDate) AS NumberOfDaysWithIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
WHERE
ir.IncidentDate BETWEEN '2019-08-01' AND '2019-10-31';



Calculating filtered aggregates
If we want to count the number of occurrences of an event given some filter criteria, 
we can take advantage of aggregate functions like SUM(), MIN(), and MAX(), as well as CASE expressions.
For example, SUM(CASE WHEN ir.IncidentTypeID = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) will return the count of incidents associated with incident type 1.
If you include one SUM() statement for each incident type, you have pivoted the data set by incident type ID.
In this scenario, management would like us to tell them, by incident type, how many "big-incident" days we have had 
versus "small-incident" days. 
Management defines a big-incident day as having more than 5 occurrences of the same incident type on the same day, and a small-incident day has between 1 and 5.
Fill in a CASE expression which lets us use the SUM() function to calculate the number of big-incident and small-incident days.
In the CASE expression, you should return 1 if the appropriate filter criterion is met and 0 otherwise.
Be sure to specify the alias when referencing a column, like ir.IncidentDate or it.IncidentType!

SELECT
	it.IncidentType,
    -- Fill in the appropriate expression
	SUM(case WHEN ir.NumberOfIncidents > 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) AS NumberOfBigIncidentDays,
    -- Number of incidents will always be at least 1, so
    -- no need to check the minimum value, just that it's
    -- less than or equal to 5
    SUM(case WHEN ir.NumberOfIncidents <= 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) AS NumberOfSmallIncidentDays
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.IncidentType it
		ON ir.IncidentTypeID = it.IncidentTypeID
WHERE
	ir.IncidentDate BETWEEN '2019-08-01' AND '2019-10-31'
GROUP BY
it.IncidentType;


IncidentType		NumberOfBigIncidentDays	NumberOfSmallIncidentDays
Clicked malicious link	8			16
Forgot key card		15			37


AVG() - average
STDEV() - standard deviation
STDEVP() - population standard deviatino
VAR() - variance
VARP() - population variance





Working with statistical aggregate functions
SQL Server offers several aggregate functions for statistical purpose. The AVG() function generates the mean of a sample. 
STDEV() and STDEVP() give us the standard deviation of a sample and of a population, respectively. 
VAR() and VARP() give us the variance of a sample and a population, respectively. 
These are in addition to the aggregate functions we learned about in the previous exercise, including SUM(), COUNT(), MIN(), and MAX().
In this exercise, we will look once more at incident rollup and incident type data, this time for quarter 2 of calendar year 2020. 
We would like to get an idea of how much spread there is in incident occurrence--that is,
if we see a consistent number of incidents on a daily basis or if we see wider swings.
Fill in the missing aggregate functions. For standard deviation and variance, use the sample functions rather than population functions.


-- Fill in the missing function names
SELECT
	it.IncidentType,
	AVG(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS MeanNumberOfIncidents,
	AVG(CAST(ir.NumberOfIncidents AS DECIMAL(4,2))) AS MeanNumberOfIncidents,
	STDEV(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidentsStandardDeviation,
	VAR(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidentsVariance,
	COUNT(1) AS NumberOfRows
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.IncidentType it
		ON ir.IncidentTypeID = it.IncidentTypeID
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	c.CalendarQuarter = 2
	AND c.CalendarYear = 2020
GROUP BY
it.IncidentType;


-----

Calculating median in SQL Server
There is no MEDIAN() function in SQL Server. The closest we have is PERCENTILE_CONT(), which finds the value at the nth percentile across a data set.
We would like to figure out how far the median differs from the mean by incident type in our incident rollup set. 
To do so, we can compare the AVG() function from the prior exercise to PERCENTILE_CONT(). 
These are window functions, which we will cover in more detail in chapter 4. 
For now, know that PERCENTILE_CONT() takes a parameter, the percentile (a decimal ranging from from 0. to 1.). 
The percentile must be within an ordered group inside the WITHIN GROUP clause and OVER a certain range if you need to partition the data. 
In the WITHIN GROUP section, we need to order by the column whose 50th percentile we want.
Fill in the missing value for PERCENTILE_CONT().
Inside the WITHIN GROUP() clause, order by number of incidents descending.
In the OVER() clause, partition by IncidentType (the actual text value, not the ID).


SELECT DISTINCT
	it.IncidentType,
	AVG(CAST(ir.NumberOfIncidents AS DECIMAL(4,2)))
	    OVER(PARTITION BY it.IncidentType) AS MeanNumberOfIncidents,
    --- Fill in the missing value
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)
    	-- Inside our group, order by number of incidents DESC
    	WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ir.NumberOfIncidents DESC)
        -- Do this for each IncidentType value
        OVER (PARTITION BY it.IncidentType) AS MedianNumberOfIncidents,
	COUNT(1) OVER (PARTITION BY it.IncidentType) AS NumberOfRows
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.IncidentType it
		ON ir.IncidentTypeID = it.IncidentTypeID
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	c.CalendarQuarter = 2
	AND c.CalendarYear = 2020;
	



Downsample to a daily grain
Rolling up data to a higher grain is a common analytical task. We may have a set of data with specific time stamps and a need to observe aggregated results. 
In SQL Server, there are several techniques available depending upon your desired grain.
For these exercises, we will look at a fictional day spa. Spa management sent out coupons to potential new customers 
for the period June 16th through 20th of 2020 and would like to see if this campaign spurred on new visits.
In this exercise, we will look at one of the simplest downsampling techniques: converting a DATETIME2 or DATETIME data type
to a data type with just a date and no time component: the DATE type.
Downsample customer visit start times to the daily grain and aggregate results.
Fill in the GROUP BY clause with any non-aggregated values in the SELECT clause (but without aliases like AS Day).


SELECT
	-- Downsample to a daily grain
    -- Cast CustomerVisitStart as a date
	cast(dsv.CustomerVisitStart AS DATE) AS Day,
	SUM(dsv.AmenityUseInMinutes) AS AmenityUseInMinutes,
	COUNT(1) AS NumberOfAttendees
FROM dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
WHERE
	dsv.CustomerVisitStart >= '2020-06-11'
	AND dsv.CustomerVisitStart < '2020-06-23'
GROUP BY
	-- When we use aggregation functions like SUM or COUNT,
    -- we need to GROUP BY the non-aggregated columns
	cast(dsv.CustomerVisitStart AS DATE)
ORDER BY
	Day;
	
	
Day		AmenityUseInMinutes	NumberOfAttendees
2020-06-11	28796			328
2020-06-12	30102			337
2020-06-13	30585			341



Downsample to a weekly grain
Management would like to see how well people have utilized the spa in 2020. 
They would like to see results by week, reviewing the total number of minutes of amenity usage, 
the number of attendees, and the customer with the largest customer ID that week to see if new customers are coming in.
We can use functions in SQL Server to downsample to a fixed grain like this. One such function is DATEPART().
Downsample the day spa visit data to a weekly grain using the DATEPART() function.
Find the customer with the largest customer ID for a given week.
Fill in the GROUP BY clause with any non-aggregated values in the SELECT clause (but without aliases like AS Week).



SELECT
	-- Downsample to a weekly grain
	DATEPART(week, dsv.CustomerVisitStart) AS Week,
	SUM(dsv.AmenityUseInMinutes) AS AmenityUseInMinutes,
	-- Find the customer with the largest customer ID for that week
	max(dsv.CustomerID) AS HighestCustomerID,
	COUNT(1) AS NumberOfAttendees
FROM dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
WHERE
	dsv.CustomerVisitStart >= '2020-01-01'
	AND dsv.CustomerVisitStart < '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY
	-- When we use aggregation functions like SUM or COUNT,
    -- we need to GROUP BY the non-aggregated columns
	DATEPART(week, dsv.CustomerVisitStart)
ORDER BY
	Week;
	
Week	AmenityUseInMinutes	HighestCustomerID	NumberOfAttendees
1	117002			90			1334
2	206917			90			2348
3	204806			90			2289
4	206902			90			2319




Downsample using a calendar table
Management liked the weekly report but they wanted to see every week in 2020, not just the weeks with amenity usage. 
We can use a calendar table to solve this problem: the calendar table includes all of the weeks, so we can join it to the dbo.DaySpaVisit table to find our answers.
Management would also like to see the first day of each calendar week, as that provides important context to report viewers.
Find and include the week of the calendar year.
Include the minimum value of c.Date in each group as FirstDateOfWeek. This works because we are grouping by week.
Join the Calendar table to the DaySpaVisit table based on the calendar table's date and each day spa customer's date of visit.
CustomerVisitStart is a DATETIME2 which includes time, so a direct join would only include visits starting at exactly midnight.
Group by the week of calendar year.



SELECT
	-- Determine the week of the calendar year
	c.CalendarWeekOfYear,
	-- Determine the earliest DATE in this group
    -- This is NOT the DayOfWeek column
	MIN(c.date) AS FirstDateOfWeek,
	ISNULL(SUM(dsv.AmenityUseInMinutes), 0) AS AmenityUseInMinutes,
	ISNULL(MAX(dsv.CustomerID), 0) AS HighestCustomerID,
	COUNT(dsv.CustomerID) AS NumberOfAttendees
FROM dbo.Calendar c
	LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
		-- Connect dbo.Calendar with dbo.DaySpaVisit
		-- To join on CustomerVisitStart, we need to turn 
        -- it into a DATE type
		ON c.Date = CAST(dsv.CustomerVisitStart AS date)
WHERE
	c.CalendarYear = 2020
GROUP BY
	-- When we use aggregation functions like SUM or COUNT,
    -- we need to GROUP BY the non-aggregated columns
	c.CalendarWeekOfYear
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarWeekOfYear;
	
CalendarWeekOfYear	FirstDateOfWeek	AmenityUseInMinutes	HighestCustomerID	NumberOfAttendees
1			2020-01-01	117002			90			1334
2			2020-01-05	206917			90			2348
3			2020-01-12	204806			90			2289




Generate a summary with ROLLUP
The ROLLUP operator works best when your non-measure attributes are hierarchical. 
Otherwise, you may end up weird aggregation levels which don't make intuitive sense.
In this scenario, we wish to aggregate the total number of security incidents in the IncidentRollup table. 
Management would like to see data aggregated by the combination of calendar year, calendar quarter, and calendar month.
In addition, they would also like to see separate aggregate lines for calendar year plus calendar quarter,
as well as separate aggregate lines for each calendar year. Finally, they would like one more line for the grand total.
We can do all of this in one operation.
Complete the definition for NumberOfIncidents by adding up the number of incidents over each range.
Fill out the GROUP BY segment, including the WITH ROLLUP operator.



SELECT
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth,
    -- Include the sum of incidents by day over each range
	sum(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	ir.IncidentTypeID = 2
GROUP BY
	-- GROUP BY needs to include all non-aggregated columns
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth
-- Fill in your grouping operator
WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth;
	

CalendarYear	CalendarQuarterName	CalendarMonth	NumberOfIncidents
null		null			null		957
2019		null			null		482
2019		Q3			null		221




View all aggregations with CUBE
The CUBE operator provides a cross aggregation of all combinations and can be a huge number of rows. 
This operator works best with non-hierarchical data where you are interested in independent aggregations as well as the combined aggregations.
In this scenario, we wish to find the total number of security incidents in the IncidentRollup table but will not follow a proper hierarchy. 
Instead, we will focus on aggregating several unrelated attributes.
Fill in the missing columns from dbo.Calendar in the SELECT clause.
Fill out the GROUP BY segment, including the CUBE operator.



SELECT
	-- Use the ORDER BY clause as a guide for these columns
    -- Don't forget that comma after the third column if you
    -- copy from the ORDER BY clause!
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.WeekOfMonth,
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	ir.IncidentTypeID IN (3, 4)
GROUP BY
	-- GROUP BY should include all non-aggregated columns
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.WeekOfMonth
-- Fill in your grouping operator
WITH CUBE
ORDER BY
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.WeekOfMonth;


IncidentTypeID	CalendarQuarterName	WeekOfMonth	NumberOfIncidents
null		null			null		1241
null		null			1		218
null		null			2		295



View all aggregations with CUBE
The CUBE operator provides a cross aggregation of all combinations and can be a huge number of rows. 
This operator works best with non-hierarchical data where you are interested in independent aggregations as well as the combined aggregations.
In this scenario, we wish to find the total number of security incidents in the IncidentRollup table but will not follow a proper hierarchy. 
Instead, we will focus on aggregating several unrelated attributes.




Generate custom groupings with GROUPING SETS
The GROUPING SETS operator allows us to define the specific aggregation levels we desire.
In this scenario, management would like to see something similar to a ROLLUP but without quite as much information. 
Instead of showing every level of aggregation in the hierarchy, management would like to see three levels: grand totals; by year; and by year, quarter, and month.
Fill out the GROUP BY segment using GROUPING SETS. We want to see:
One row for each combination of year, quarter, and month (in that hierarchical order)
One row for each year
One row with grand totals (that is, a blank group)



SELECT
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth,
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	ir.IncidentTypeID = 2
-- Fill in your grouping operator here
GROUP BY grouping sets
(
  	-- Group in hierarchical order:  calendar year,
    -- calendar quarter name, calendar month
	(CalendarYear, CalendarQuarterName, CalendarMonth),
  	-- Group by calendar year
	(CalendarYear),
    -- This remains blank; it gives us the grand total
	()
)
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth;
	

CalendarYear	CalendarQuarterName	CalendarMonth	NumberOfIncidents
null		null			null		957
2019		null			null		482
2019		Q3			7		71



Combine multiple aggregations in one query
In the last three exercises, we walked through the ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS grouping operators. 
Of these three, GROUPING SETS is the most customizable, allowing you to build out exactly the levels of aggregation you want.
GROUPING SETS makes no assumptions about hierarchy (unlike ROLLUP) and can remain manageable with a good number of columns (unlike CUBE).
In this exercise, we want to test several conjectures with our data:
We have seen fewer incidents per month since introducing training in November of 2019.
More incidents occur on Tuesday than on other weekdays.
More incidents occur on weekends than weekdays.
Fill out the grouping sets based on our conjectures above. We want to see the following grouping sets in addition to our grand total:
One set by calendar year and month
One set by the day of the week
One set by whether the date is a weekend or not


SELECT
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarMonth,
	c.DayOfWeek,
	c.IsWeekend,
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS
(
    -- Each non-aggregated column from above should appear once
  	-- Calendar year and month
	(CalendarYear, CalendarMonth),
  	-- Day of week
	(DayOfWeek),
  	-- Is weekend or not
	(IsWeekend),
    -- This remains empty; it gives us the grand total
	()
)
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarMonth,
	c.DayOfWeek,
	c.IsWeekend;
	
CalendarYear	CalendarMonth	DayOfWeek	IsWeekend	NumberOfIncidents
null		null		null		null		3756
null		null		null		false		2677
null		null		null		true		1079
null		null		1		null		536

null		null		3		null		539
