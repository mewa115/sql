Numbering rows
The simplest application for window functions is numbering rows. 
Numbering rows allows you to easily fetch the nth row. 
For example, it would be very difficult to get the 35th row in any given table if you didn't have a column with each row's number.

SELECT
  *,
  -- Assign numbers to each row
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS Row_N
FROM Summer_Medals
ORDER BY Row_N ASC;


Numbering Olympic games in ascending order
The Summer Olympics dataset contains the results of the games between 1896 and 2012. 
The first Summer Olympics were held in 1896, the second in 1900, and so on. 
What if you want to easily query the table to see in which year the 13th Summer Olympics were held? You'd need to number the rows for that.


SELECT
  Year,
  -- Assign numbers to each year
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS Row_N
FROM (
  SELECT distinct city, year
  FROM Summer_Medals
  ORDER BY Year ASC
) AS Years
ORDER BY Year ASC;


Numbering Olympic games in descending order
You've already numbered the rows in the Summer Medals dataset. 
What if you need to reverse the row numbers so that the most recent Olympic games' rows have a lower number?

SELECT
  Year,
  -- Assign the lowest numbers to the most recent years
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (order by year desc) AS Row_N
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT Year
  FROM Summer_Medals
) AS Years
ORDER BY Year;


Numbering Olympic athletes by medals earned
Row numbering can also be used for ranking. 
For example, numbering rows and ordering by the count of medals each athlete earned in the OVER clause will assign 1 to the highest-earning medalist, 
2 to the second highest-earning medalist, and so on.

SELECT
  -- Count the number of medals each athlete has earned
  athlete,
  count(*) AS Medals
FROM Summer_Medals
GROUP BY Athlete
ORDER BY Medals DESC;



Numbering Olympic athletes by medals earned
Row numbering can also be used for ranking. 
For example, numbering rows and ordering by the count of medals each athlete earned in the OVER clause will assign 1 to the highest-earning medalist, 
2 to the second highest-earning medalist, and so on.

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    -- Count the number of medals each athlete has earned
    Athlete,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Number each athlete by how many medals they've earned
  athlete,
  row_number() OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Row_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Medals DESC;



Reigning weightlifting champions
A reigning champion is a champion who's won both the previous and current years' competitions. 
To determine if a champion is reigning, the previous and current years' results need to be in the same row, in two different columns.
Return each year's gold medalists in the Men's 69KG weightlifting competition.

SELECT
  -- Return each year's champions' countries
  year,
  country AS champion
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Discipline = 'Weightlifting' AND
  Event = '69KG' AND
  Gender = 'Men' AND
  Medal = 'Gold';
  
  
  
  
Having wrapped the previous query in the Weightlifting_Gold CTE, get the previous year's champion for each year.
  
WITH Weightlifting_Gold AS (
  SELECT
    -- Return each year's champions' countries
    Year,
    Country AS champion
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Discipline = 'Weightlifting' AND
    Event = '69KG' AND
    Gender = 'Men' AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Year, Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion
  LAG(Champion,1) OVER
    (ORDER BY YEAR ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Weightlifting_Gold
ORDER BY Year ASC;




Reigning champions by gender
You've already fetched the previous year's champion for one event. 
However, if you have multiple events, genders, or other metrics as columns, 
you'll need to split your table into partitions to avoid having a champion from one event or gender appear as the previous champion of another event or gender.
Return the previous champions of each year's event by gender.

WITH Tennis_Gold AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Gender, Year, Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year >= 2000 AND
    Event = 'Javelin Throw' AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Gender, Year,
  Country AS Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion by gender
  lag(Country) OVER (Partition by gender
            ORDER BY YEAR ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Tennis_Gold
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Year ASC;


Reigning champions by gender and event
In the previous exercise, you partitioned by gender to ensure that data about one gender doesn't get mixed into data about the other gender. 
If you have multiple columns, however, partitioning by only one of them will still mix the results of the other columns.
Return the previous champions of each year's events by gender and event.

WITH Athletics_Gold AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Gender, Year, Event, Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year >= 2000 AND
    Discipline = 'Athletics' AND
    Event IN ('100M', '10000M') AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Gender, Year, Event,
  Country AS Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion by gender and event
  lag(Country) OVER (partition by gender, event
            ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Athletics_Gold
ORDER BY Event ASC, Gender ASC, Year ASC;


Future gold medalists
Fetching functions allow you to get values from different parts of the table into one row.
If you have time-ordered data, you can "peek into the future" with the LEAD fetching function. 
This is especially useful if you want to compare a current value to a future value.
For each year, fetch the current gold medalist and the gold medalist 3 competitions ahead of the current row.



Fetching functions allow you to get values from different parts of the table into one row.

This is especially useful if you want to compare a current value to a future value.
For each year, fetch the current gold medalist and the gold medalist 3 competitions ahead of the current row.

WITH Discus_Medalists AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Year,
    Athlete
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Event = 'Discus Throw'
    AND Gender = 'Women'
    AND Year >= 2000)

SELECT
  -- For each year, fetch the current and future medalists
  year,
  Athlete,
  lead(Athlete,3) OVER (ORDER BY year ASC) AS Future_Champion
FROM Discus_Medalists
ORDER BY Year ASC;


First athlete by name
It's often useful to get the first or last value in a dataset to compare all other values to it. 
With absolute fetching functions like FIRST_VALUE, you can fetch a value at an absolute position in the table, like its beginning or end.
Return all athletes and the first athlete ordered by alphabetical order.

WITH All_Male_Medalists AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Athlete
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Gender = 'Men')

SELECT
  -- Fetch all athletes and the first athlete alphabetically
  athlete,
  first_value(athlete) OVER (
    ORDER BY athlete ASC
  ) AS First_Athlete
FROM All_Male_Medalists;



Last country by name
Just like you can get the first row's value in a dataset, you can get the last row's value. 
This is often useful when you want to compare the most recent value to previous values.
Return the year and the city in which each Olympic games were held.
Fetch the last city in which the Olympic games were held.

WITH Hosts AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT Year, City
    FROM Summer_Medals)

SELECT
  Year,
  City,
  -- Get the last city in which the Olympic games were held
  last_value(city) OVER (
   ORDER BY year ASC
   RANGE BETWEEN
     UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND
     UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  ) AS Last_City
FROM Hosts
ORDER BY Year ASC;


Running totals of athlete medals
The running total (or cumulative sum) of a column helps you determine what each row's contribution is to the total sum.
Return the athletes, the number of medals they earned, and the medals running total, ordered by the athletes' names in alphabetical order.

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'USA' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Calculate the running total of athlete medals
  athlete,
  medals,
  sum(medals) OVER (ORDER BY athlete ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Athlete ASC;



Maximum country medals by year
Getting the maximum of a country's earned medals so far helps you determine whether a country has broken 
its medals record by comparing the current year's earned medals and the maximum so far.
Return the year, country, medals, and the maximum medals earned so far for each country, ordered by year in ascending order.

WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, Country, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('CHN', 'KOR', 'JPN')
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year, Country)

SELECT
  -- Return the max medals earned so far per country
  year,
  country,
  medals,
  max(medals) OVER (PARTITION BY country
                ORDER BY year ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Country_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;




Minimum country medals by year
So far, you've seen MAX and SUM, aggregate functions normally used with GROUP BY, being used as window functions. 
You can also use the other aggregate functions, like MIN, as window functions.
Return the year, medals earned, and minimum medals earned so far.

WITH France_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'FRA'
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  year,
  medals,
  min(medals) OVER (ORDER BY year ASC) AS Min_Medals
FROM France_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;



Moving maximum of Scandinavian athletes' medals
Frames allow you to restrict the rows passed as input to your window function to a sliding window for you to define the start and finish.
Adding a frame to your window function allows you to calculate "moving" metrics, inputs of which slide from row to row.
Return the year, medals earned, and the maximum medals earned, comparing only the current year and the next year.

WITH Scandinavian_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'FIN', 'SWE', 'ISL')
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  -- Select each year's medals
  year,
  medals,
  -- Get the max of the current and next years'  medals
  max(medals) OVER (ORDER BY year ASC
             ROWS BETWEEN current row
             AND 1 following) AS Max_Medals
FROM Scandinavian_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;



Moving maximum of Chinese athletes' medals
Frames allow you to "peek" forwards or backward without first using the relative fetching functions, LAG and LEAD, to fetch previous rows' values into the current row.
Return the athletes, medals earned, and the maximum medals earned, comparing only the last two and current athletes, ordering by athletes' names in alphabetical order.

WITH Chinese_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'CHN' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Select the athletes and the medals they've earned
  athlete,
  medals,
  -- Get the max of the last two and current rows' medals 
  max(medals) OVER (ORDER BY Athlete ASC
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 preceding
            AND current row) AS Max_Medals
FROM Chinese_Medals




Moving average of Russian medals
Using frames with aggregate window functions allow you to calculate many common metrics, including moving averages and totals. 
These metrics track the change in performance over time.
Calculate the 3-year moving average of medals earned.


WITH Russian_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'RUS'
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 1980
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  Year, Medals,
  --- Calculate the 3-year moving average of medals earned
  avg(medals) OVER
    (ORDER BY Year ASC
     ROWS BETWEEN
     2 preceding AND current row) AS Medals_MA
FROM Russian_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;




Moving total of countries' medals
What if your data is split into multiple groups spread over one or more columns in the table? 
Even with a defined frame, if you can't somehow separate the groups' data, one group's values will affect the average of another group's values.
Calculate the 3-year moving sum of medals earned per country.

WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, Country, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Year, Country)

SELECT
  Year, Country, Medals,
  -- Calculate each country's 3-game moving total
  sum(medals) OVER
    (PARTITION BY country
     ORDER BY Year ASC
     ROWS BETWEEN
     2 preceding AND current row) AS Medals_MA
FROM Country_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;



A basic pivot
You have the following table of Pole Vault gold medalist countries by gender in 2008 and 2012.

| Gender | Year | Country |
|--------|------|---------|
| Men    | 2008 | AUS     |
| Men    | 2012 | FRA     |
| Women  | 2008 | RUS     |
| Women  | 2012 | USA     |
Pivot it by Year to get the following reshaped, cleaner table.

| Gender | 2008 | 2012 |
|--------|------|------|
| Men    | AUS  | FRA  |
| Women  | RUS  | USA  |

Create the correct extension.
Fill in the column names of the pivoted table.

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  SELECT
    Gender, Year, Country

  WHERE
    Year IN (2008, 2012)
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Event = 'Pole Vault'
  ORDER By Gender ASC, Year ASC;

$$) AS ct (gender VARCHAR,
          year VARCHAR,
           country VARCHAR)
ORDER BY Gender ASC;



Pivoting with ranking
You want to produce an easy scannable table of the rankings of the three most populous EU countries by how many gold medals they've earned 
in the 2004 through 2012 Olympic games. The table needs to be in this format:
| Country | 2004 | 2008 | 2012 |
|---------|------|------|------|
| FRA     | ...  | ...  | ...  |
| GBR     | ...  | ...  | ...  |
| GER     | ...  | ...  | ...  |
You'll need to count the gold medals each country has earned, produce the ranks of each country by medals earned, then pivot the table to this shape.
Count the gold medals that France (FRA), the UK (GBR), and Germany (GER) have earned per country and year.

-- Count the gold medals per country and year
SELECT
  country,
  year,
  count(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
  AND Year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
GROUP BY country, year
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC



Select the country and year columns, then rank the three countries by how many gold medals they earned per year.

WITH Country_Awards AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    Year,
    COUNT(*) AS Awards
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
    AND Year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Country, Year)

SELECT
  -- Select Country and Year
  country,
  year,
  -- Rank by gold medals earned per year
  sum(Awards) :: INTEGER AS rank
FROM Country_Awards
group by country_awards.country, country_awards.year
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;


Pivot the query's results by Year by filling in the new table's correct column names.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  WITH Country_Awards AS (
    SELECT
      Country,
      Year,
      COUNT(*) AS Awards

      Country IN ('FRA', 'GBR', 'GER')
      AND Year IN (2004, 2008, 2012)
      AND Medal = 'Gold'
    GROUP BY Country, Year)

  SELECT
    Country,
    Year,
    RANK() OVER
      (PARTITION BY Year
       ORDER BY Awards DESC) :: INTEGER AS rank
  FROM Country_Awards
  ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;

           "2004" INTEGER,
           "2008" INTEGER,
           "2012" INTEGER)

Order by Country ASC;


Country-level subtotals
You want to look at three Scandinavian countries' earned gold medals per country and gender in the year 2000. 
You're also interested in Country-level subtotals to get the total medals earned for each country, 
but Gender-level subtotals don't make much sense in this case, so disregard them.
Count the gold medals awarded per country and gender.
Generate Country-level gold award counts.
-- Count the gold medals per country and gender
SELECT
  country,
  gender,
  COUNT(*) AS Gold_Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2004
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
  AND Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'SWE')
-- Generate Country-level subtotals
GROUP BY country, rollup(gender)
ORDER BY Country ASC, Gender ASC;




You want to break down all medals awarded to Russia in the 2012 Olympic games per gender and medal type. 
Since the medals all belong to one country, Russia, it makes sense to generate all possible subtotals (Gender- and Medal-level subtotals), as well as a grand total.
Generate a breakdown of the medals awarded to Russia per country and medal type, including all group-level subtotals and a grand total.
Count the medals awarded per gender and medal type.
Generate all possible group-level counts (per gender and medal type subtotals and the grand total).


-- Count the medals per country and medal type
SELECT
  gender,
  medal,
  count(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2012
  AND Country = 'RUS'
-- Get all possible group-level subtotals
GROUP BY cube(gender, medal)
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Medal ASC;



Cleaning up results
Returning to the breakdown of Scandinavian awards you previously made, you want to clean up the results by replacing the nulls with meaningful text.
Turn the nulls in the Country column to All countries, and the nulls in the Gender column to All genders.
SELECT
  -- Replace the nulls in the columns with meaningful text
  coalesce(Country, 'All countries') AS Country,
  coalesce(Gender, 'All genders') AS Gender,
  COUNT(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2004
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
  AND Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'SWE')
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Country, Gender)
ORDER BY Country ASC, Gender ASC;



Summarizing results
After ranking each country in the 2000 Olympics by gold medals awarded, you want to return the top 3 countries in one row, 
as a comma-separated string. In other words, turn this:

| Country | Rank |
|---------|------|
| USA     | 1    |
| RUS     | 2    |
| AUS     | 3    |
| ...     | ...  |
into this:
USA, RUS, AUS
Rank countries by the medals they've been awarded.

WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE Year = 2000
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Country)

  SELECT
    Country,
    -- Rank countries by the medals awarded
    rank() over(order by medals desc) AS Rank
  FROM Country_Medals
  ORDER BY Rank ASC;
  
  
  Return the top 3 countries by medals awarded as one comma-separated string.
  
  WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
