Simple selections
It's time to begin writing your own queries! In this first coding exercise, you will use SELECT statements to retrieve columns from a database table. 
You'll be working with the eurovision table, which contains data relating to individual country performance at the Eurovision Song Contest from 1998 to 2012.
After selecting columns, you'll also practice renaming columns, and limiting the number of rows returned.

Use TOP to change the existing query so that only the first 50 rows are returned.

-- Limit the number of rows returned
SELECT 
  top (50) points 
FROM 
  eurovision;
